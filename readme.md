## Boombox is now archived
Unfortunately, Discord has removed Boombox's verifcation status, meaning it can no longer join any servers. Because of this we have made the decision to shutdown the bot and archive this repository.

## Getting Started

The eaisest way to start Boombox is by using docker. Docker will automaticly install Lavalink, Redis and build the image for the bot. To get started follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker and docker-compose installed. You can find instructions on how to install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/">Docker here, </a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/"> docker-compose here. </a>

Make sure you have Node >= 14 installed.

### Docker Install

1.  Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Boombox-Discord/Boombox.git
```

2.  Rename config-example.json to config.json and insert your own values. Leave the redis fields as they are.

3.  Get a clientID and client secret for Spotify [from here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and paste it into the config file. This allows you to play music from Spotify links.

4.  Rename lavalink-config-example.yml to lavalink-config.yml and replace password with something different. Make sure to put this password in the config.json file under lavalinkPassword.

5.  Run docker-compose

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This will automaticly register the slash commands with discord using the token provided in config.json. These can take up to one hour to appear in Discord.

### Other ways to install

If you would like to run Boombox using Node or using our Docker image then you can find more information about this on our <a href="https://docs.boomboxdiscord.dev/installing-boombox"> docs here. </a>
